## State Estimation
- **Goal:** Determine **where we are in space** and **how we got there**.
- Needed to **plan sequences of movements** to reach a desired position.
- Requires understanding:
    - **Pose representations** (position + orientation)
    - **Coordinate transformations** for rigid bodies (e.g., F1TENTH race car).

## Coordinate Frames and Transformations

### Frames and Transformations on Autonomous Vehicles
- **Sensors provide measurements in their own frame of reference.**
    - Navigation requires **fusing multiple sensor perspectives**.
    - Each sensor is first **processed individually**, then combined.
- **Multiple sensor outputs** can be combined to produce a **Bird’s Eye View**.
- **Mapping** is usually done by tying together submaps.

### What is a Coordinate Frame?
1. A **set of orthogonal axes** attached to a body that describes positions of points relative to that body.
2. Axes intersect at a point called the **origin**.

**Why coordinate frames are needed:**
- Compact representation of points and orientations.
- Coordinates are meaningless without specifying the frame.
	- Allows understanding and relating quantities observed by **different sensors or robots** at different time steps.

### Right-handed Coordinate Frames
- **Direction of axes is important.**
- Mnemonic:
    - Positive **x-axis** is index finger
    - Positive **y-axis** is middle finger
    - Positive **z-axis** is thumb
- **Right-handed systems** are standard in robotics.
- Left-handed systems are sometimes used in graphics.

### Transformations and Frames
- **Map frame:** Defines where the robot is relative to a fixed world origin.
- **Sensor frame:** Defines where obstacles are relative to the sensor.
- **Measurements in the sensor frame** do **not directly tell you where obstacles are in the map**
	- Must account for offsets $Δx, Δy, Δz$ from the center of the car.
- **Transformations** allow converting measurements **from one frame to another**.
**Two types of transformations:**
1. **Static transformations:** Fixed offsets (e.g., sensor mounted on the car).
2. **Dynamic transformations:** Change over time (e.g., moving robot, rotating sensors)

## Rigid Body Transformations and Reference Frames on F1TENTH
**Rigid Body Definition:**
- A rigid body maintains **constant distances between any two points** regardless of external forces.
- Deformations are assumed negligible relative to motion.

**Rigid Body Motion:**
1. **Translation (rectilinear or curvilinear):**
    - Motion of the body can be described by the motion of any single point.
    - All points share the **same velocity and acceleration**.
2. **Rotation about a fixed axis:**
    - All particles move in **circular paths around the axis**.
    - Motion is fully determined by the **angular velocity** of rotation

**Why we need transforms between frames:**
- Sensor data is usually provided in the **sensor’s local frame**.
- To **localize on a map**, we need transformations:
    - From **laser frame to map frame** (obstacle positions in global coordinates)
    - Between **components on the car** for accurate actuation
    - Between **submaps** for building a consistent global map

## Reference Frames on F1TENTH
- **map:** Global frame representing the environment; origin set arbitrarily when creating the map and kept consistent.
- **base_link:** Actuation frame, centered at the car’s rear axle; moves with the car relative to map.
- **laser:** Measurement frame for LIDAR scans; moves with the car; transformation to base_link is static.
- **odom:** Odometry frame; tracks relative motion and provides pose estimates of the car relative to odom.

**Key Points:**
- Measurements in the **laser frame** give information about obstacles and relative robot position.
- Measurements in the **map frame** align observations with the global environment.
- Planning, TTC, and safety computations are more accurate in the **global frame**.
- Example: TTC calculations can differ depending on travel direction if only laser-frame measurements are used; adding a **chassis-centered frame** standardizes calculations.

## Rigid Body Transformations
- The lecture does a poor job of explaining, so don't worry if you didn't understand the math section. Instead, watch these 3 videos and make sure you understand them:
- Part 1: **Introduction**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvgGSgvB2I0
- Part 2: **Forward Kinematics**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8T7RjXL07M
- Part 3: **Inverse Kinematics**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D0sO8mymQ8
- We go from 2D to 3D using homogeneous coordinates because translations cannot be represented as linear transformations in 2D since adding a vector is not linear.
- The extra dimension allows us to combine rotation and translation into a single linear operation.
- We embed our 2D coordinates into a **fixed** 3D system using homogeneous coordinates, where $z = 1$ for all points. We never change $z$.

### Rigid Body Transform Notation
- **$\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{p}'$** : original and transformed points in standard coordinates
- **$\mathbf{P}, \mathbf{P}'$** : original and transformed points in homogeneous coordinates; extra variable is **set to 1 and never changed**
- **$R$** : rotation matrix ($2\times 2$ for 2D, $3\times 3$ for 3D)
- **$\mathbf{t}$** : translation vector
- **$r_{ij}$** : entry of the rotation matrix at row $i$, column $j$ of the rotation matrix. It shows how the rotation moves the original axes ($x$, $y$, $z$) to the new axes ($x'$, $y'$, $z'$). In 3D, all the $r_{ij}$ numbers together control rotations around $x$, $y$, and $z$ (yaw, pitch, roll).
- **Summary** : standard vector form $\mathbf{p}' = R \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{t}$; homogeneous form $\mathbf{P}' = T \mathbf{P}$, with the extra variable **fixed at 1**

### 1. 2D Rigid Body Transform
**Standard vector form:**
$$
\mathbf{p}' = R \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{t}
$$
$$
\mathbf{p} =
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}, \quad
\mathbf{p}' =
\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{bmatrix}, \quad
R =
\begin{bmatrix} 
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ 
\sin\theta & \cos\theta 
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\mathbf{t} =
\begin{bmatrix} t_x \\ t_y \end{bmatrix}
$$
**Homogeneous coordinates form**:
$$
\mathbf{P}' = T \mathbf{P}, \quad
\mathbf{P} =
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
\mathbf{P}' =
\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
T =
\begin{bmatrix} 
R & \mathbf{t} \\ 
0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} 
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta & t_x \\ 
\sin\theta & \cos\theta & t_y \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### 2. 3D Rigid Body Transform
**Standard vector form:**
$$
\mathbf{p}' = R \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{t}
$$
$$
\mathbf{p} =
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}, \quad
\mathbf{p}' =
\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ z' \end{bmatrix}, \quad
R =
\begin{bmatrix} 
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} \\ 
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} \\ 
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} 
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\mathbf{t} =
\begin{bmatrix} t_x \\ t_y \\ t_z \end{bmatrix}
$$
**Homogeneous coordinates form**:
$$
\mathbf{P}' = T \mathbf{P}, \quad
\mathbf{P} =
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
\mathbf{P}' =
\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ z' \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
T =
\begin{bmatrix} 
R & \mathbf{t} \\ 
0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} 
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_x \\ 
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_y \\ 
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_z \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### 3. Additional Notes on Rotation Matrices and Inverses
- **Rotation matrices $R$** are **orthogonal** and have **determinant 1**, which means they preserve lengths and angles when rotating points.
- **Why $R^T$ works:** $R^T$ reverses the rotation because the transpose of an orthogonal matrix is also its inverse, so applying $R^T$ “undoes” the original rotation.
- **Why the inverse translation is $-R^T \mathbf{t}$:** After reversing the rotation with $R^T$, we must also move back by the opposite of the original translation, which becomes $-R^T \mathbf{t}$ in the transformed frame.
- **Inverse of a rigid body transform $T$**:
$$
T^{-1} =
\begin{bmatrix}
R^T & -R^T \mathbf{t} \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\text{where } R^T \text{ reverses the rotation, and } -R^T \mathbf{t} \text{ reverses the translation.}
$$

### Poses & Transformations
- Points, directions, and displacements are represented by **n-dimensional vectors**.
- Rotations and scalings are represented by **n×n matrices**.
- **Rigid transformations** consist of a rotation followed by a translation; they represent both rigid body motion and changes of coordinate frame.
- **Homogeneous coordinates:** represent rigid transforms in **(n+1)-dimensional space**, last coordinate 0 for vectors, 1 for points.
**Practical Tip:**
- Clear assumptions, consistent notation, and/or using coordinate management tools reduces the risk of errors when working with multiple frames and transformations.
